# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to create a vacation map that allows users to apply weather criteria to identify potential travel destinations. By utilizing Google API's, we also provide the user with recommended ideal hotels within there preferred travel destinations.

## Data
This folder uses the Open Weather Map API to pull weather information on over 720 different cities around the world. That information consists of:

**Maximum Temperature**
- Wind Speed
- Humidity
- Cloudiness
- Current Weather Description

**Vacation Search**

This folder takes the information gained in the weather database and uses Google Maps API to plot different travel destinations with a hotel at each location. 

**Vacation itinerary**

This folder takes the search information from the search folder and uses Google Maps directions API to create a vacation itinerary. For example, the image below shows a 4 stop itinerary in from Spain to France.
