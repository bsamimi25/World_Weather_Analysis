# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to create a vacation map that allows users to apply weather criteria to identify potential travel destinations. By utilizing Google API's, we also provide the user with recommended ideal hotels within there preferred travel destinations.

This project was to essentially use multiple APIs and have them overlap in terms of an end result, that being with this project being Vacation spots for the user to choose from with Hotel Destinations. I wanted to gather multiple criteria from the OpenWeather API and have that interact with the Google Places API by retrieving Hotel Locations by connecting through latitude and longitudes.I created multiple heatmaps based on different criteria as well using the Google Maps API for nice visualizations. 

## Data

- Maximum Temperature 
- City

Please check the (Weather_and_Google_API) for the relevant python files.
